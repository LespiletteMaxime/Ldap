LDAP plugin for Laravel 4.x
===========================

I know that a bundle already exists to manage LDAP auth in Laravel, but, it only works for Laravel 3.X, and it's made for authentication.  
I know you could use the LDAP Zend Class in Laravel as a vendor. Why not ? ... because it was a bit too much for what I needed.  
Considering this plugin from a CRUD point of view, this is only a R.  
Considering this plugin from a Geek point of view, this is my first time writing a plugin for Laravel 4.X as a Composer Package.
